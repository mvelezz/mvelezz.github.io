This portfolio represents the culmination of the knowledge I learned at Southern New Hampshire University. Throughout this portfolio, I will be modifying a personal project to meet standards and desired outcomes. 

Below is a video of my code review of this project and how I will be improving upon it.

**ENHANCEMENT ONE**
 
The artifact that I chose for this enhancement is a tee time reservation system. It was created as a personal project to improve my Java skills about one year ago. I wanted to include this artifact in my portfolio because it was something that I built on my own. This not only shows my motivation to build software but also shows an understanding of Java. The artifact was improved by moving it from Java to Python. I know of many companies that are moving from one language to another, so this was a great way to showcase my ability to do just that. The course outcomes that I met for this artifact are below.

**Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts.**

I believe that I have effectively met this course outcome. I have vastly improved the readability and comments in my code. This along with my recorded code review have showcased my skills in communicating and delivering professional quality communication to potential developers who would be looking at this code.

**Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision-making in the field of computer science.**

I believe this artifact also meets this course outcome. By creating code that is readable and maintainable, I have opened the door for other developers to collaborate with me. I also believe writing clean code that is orthogonal will really help decision makers in the field of computer science as when one part of the program needs to be changed, it can be done easily and effectively. 
I learned a lot while developing this application. The differences in Python and Java are immense and it was far more challenging than I originally expected. I ran into issues with objects not working how I wanted them to in the menus, but I was able to overcome my struggles and get my program running exactly how it should work. 

I have included images of my program running in both Python and Java below. The link to the branch of this repository is [HERE](https://github.com/mvelezz/CS499/tree/branch1)
